Class Name: Odometer
  This class tracks fuels and mileage for an automotive vehicle
  Data: num_miles - holds number of miles
        num_gallons - holds number of gallons used
        fuel - contains fuel efficiency value in miles per gallons

  Private:
        get_gallons_based_on_miles_and_efficiency - gets the number of gallons
                                                    based on miles and efficiency

  Public:
  Mutator Functions:
        Odometer - default constructor
        Odometer - sets miles and gallons. If values already exist, add them
                      up. It also calculates the fuel efficiency and sets
                      the value
        reset_metrics - resets miles and gallons to zero. (Also resets fuel to 0)

  Accessor Functions:
        get_miles - returns the miles driven
        get_gallons - returns the number of gallons used
        get_efficiency - returns the fuel efficiency
